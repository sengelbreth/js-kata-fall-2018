# JS-KATA

## Week 1, Day 4

### Modal window

You are going to create a modal window with CSS and JavaScript.

---

This kata contains some materials to get you started.  
Copy everything from the `materials` folder, to the `mysolution` folder.  
Use the terminal, and write: `cp ./materials/* ./mysolution/`

---

Modify the CSS, and create the necessary JavaScript-code to show the #modal*container whenever one of the \_details* links are clicked. (The same modal shows for all products, and the content doesn't change).

The #modal_container must block out everything else on the page. (But can be semi-transparent if you like).

Clicking the closebutton in the modal-window, hides it, and allows the user to click details once again.

You can modify the HTML if you want to.

**You can't use jQuery, Bootstrap, or any other framework!**

## Hints

- Use events to register clicks on the details-links
- Use and expand the existing JavaScript functions to hide and show the modal window.
- Add and remove a class to hide/show the modal window.

### Optional

Make the page look as good as possible - design the best looking modal window ever!
